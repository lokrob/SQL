#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database from the prompt below to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

-- 1. Write a SQL query that orders the items by price

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

-- What this code does is retrieve all items ordered by price in ascending order.
-- Helps with price comparisons and can be useful for quickly identifying low cost or high cost products.


-- 2. Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT 
SUM(price) AS Sum of Price, 
AVG(price) AS Average Price, 
MIN(price) AS Minimum Price, 
MAX(price) AS Maximum Price, 
COUNT(price) AS Count of Price
FROM superstore;

-- What this code does is compute descriptive statistics for item prices across the store.
-- Includes summation, average, minimum, maximum, and count to provide info of the overall pricing distributions in the data set.
-- Used AS commands to rename the columns to be more readable and presentable.


-- 3. Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

SELECT SUM(price), AVG(price), MIN(price), MAX(price), COUNT(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;
-- What this code does is compute the same statistics as #3 but more narrowed down to the "Kitchen Supplies" category.
-- Demonstrates the ability to use filters to narrow down and analyze a category specific revenue or pricing trend.


-- 4. How many air purifiers are in stock?

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = 'Air Purifier'
;
-- What this code does is find the stock availibility for air purifiers and helps with inventory management.
